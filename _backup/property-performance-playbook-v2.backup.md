## The Uncomfortable Truth

The middle market for vacation rentals is getting squeezed.

Since 2020, active U.S. short-term rental listings have grown over 60%. That supply surge has slowed -- but the inventory it added is not going anywhere. Guests have more choices than ever. And when more properties compete for the same bookings, the ones that stand out capture a disproportionate share of revenue. According to Airbnb's own data, top-performing hosts earn 29-64% more than average ones and fill roughly 20 more nights per year. Meanwhile, one in four STR owners reported making no profit or losing money in 2024.

The properties that land in the middle -- decent but unremarkable -- are the ones feeling the most pressure. They're not bad enough to fail spectacularly. They're just not distinctive enough to stand out. And in a market where guests scroll past dozens of listings in seconds, "good enough" is an expensive position to be in.

This pressure is likely to intensify. The AI boom is accelerating a K-shaped economy -- one where the people who have money have more of it, and the people who don't have less. That divide has direct implications for vacation rentals. The guests who will have the means to book in the coming years will be wealthier, more discerning, and less willing to settle for mediocre spaces. Their expectations for quality, design, and experience will only go up. Meanwhile, booking platforms are already using AI-driven algorithms that track the entire guest journey and heavily reward properties with consistently strong quality signals. The bar is rising from both sides -- guest expectations and platform visibility -- and properties stuck in the middle will feel it most.

The uncomfortable truth is this: **interior design is not an expense line on your pro forma. It is a revenue lever.** How you design your property determines whether it sits in the profitable top tier or gets squeezed in the middle.

This playbook will show you exactly how.

## What's Actually at Stake

Before we get into frameworks, let's look at the numbers.

Two investors purchase comparable properties in St. George, Utah. Same neighborhood, same size, same purchase price. The only difference is how they approach interior design.

### Property A: The Budget Approach

The investor furnishes the property for **$50,000**. The space is functional but unremarkable -- basic furniture, minimal accessories, no cohesive theme. It looks like a furnished house, not a destination.

- **Occupancy:** ~55% at $325/night
- **Gross revenue:** ~$65,000/year
- **Net cash flow (after mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities, management, maintenance):** **-$11,500/year**

Property A "saved" $40,000 on design. It now loses money every month.

### Property B: The Strategic Approach

The investor works with a designer and invests **$90,000** in a strategically designed interior. The property photographs beautifully, converts at a higher rate, and delivers guest experiences that generate five-star reviews and repeat bookings.

- **Occupancy:** ~70% at $375/night
- **Gross revenue:** ~$96,000/year
- **Net cash flow:** **+$8,700/year**

Property B invested $40,000 more in design. It generates $20,200 more per year in cash flow than Property A.

### The 5-Year View

| | Property A | Property B |
|---|---|---|
| Design investment | $50,000 | $90,000 |
| Year 1 cash flow | -$11,500 | +$8,700 |
| 5-year cumulative cash flow | -$57,500 | +$43,500 |
| **5-year difference** | | **$101,000** |

That is a **$101,000 swing** over five years -- on top of property appreciation, tax advantages, and the compounding effect of a stronger review profile. The $40,000 "savings" on Property A did not save anything. It cost the investor over $100,000 in lost cash flow.

Design is not an expense to minimize. It is an investment with measurable, compounding returns. The question is not "how little can I spend?" The question is "how strategically can I spend?"

So what actually separates Property B from Property A? It is not just spending more money. It is spending it on the things that drive revenue -- and that starts with understanding what design is really doing for you.

## The 3 Performance Stages

Every dollar you spend on design should serve one of three jobs. We call them the Performance Stages, and they mirror the guest journey from first click to five-star review. Property B nails all three. Property A barely addresses the first.

### Stage 1: Stop the Scroll

Your listing photos are your storefront. Guests scroll through dozens of thumbnails before clicking on one. The properties that get clicks are the ones with visually distinctive, magazine-quality photos.

**What drives it:** Strategic color, cohesive styling, layered accessories, proper lighting, and a clear visual identity. Not expensive furniture -- visual impact.

**The test:** Would someone pause mid-scroll and tap your listing? Or does it blend into the sea of gray-couch-white-wall interiors?

### Stage 2: Convert Browsers to Bookers

Once a guest clicks, they're evaluating whether your property is worth the nightly rate. This is where design earns its keep. Spaces that look intentional, comfortable, and well-appointed justify higher ADR. Spaces that look sparse or generic push guests to keep shopping.

**What drives it:** Complete, well-proportioned rooms. Quality mattresses and bedding. Full-capacity seating and dining. Functional kitchens. Cohesive theming that makes the property feel like a destination, not just a place to sleep.

**The test:** Does your listing justify a $50-75/night premium over comparable properties? Or are you competing on price?

### Stage 3: Create Memorable Experiences

This is where long-term profitability lives. Properties that deliver memorable guest experiences generate five-star reviews, repeat bookings, and referrals -- all of which compound over time into sustained high occupancy.

**What drives it:** Thoughtful flow that brings groups together naturally. Comfort details guests notice (sleep quality, kitchen functionality, outdoor furniture and seating). A sense of place that makes the property feel special rather than transactional.

**The test:** Do guests mention the property itself in their reviews? Or do they only talk about the location?

Every design decision you make either strengthens or weakens one of these stages. Strategic design addresses all three. Most properties only think about the first one -- and even then, not very well.

## 3 Design Lenses

The Performance Stages tell you what your design should accomplish. But there is a second strategic question that most investors skip entirely: who are you designing for?

Not all guests want the same thing, and the most effective vacation rental design starts with a clear picture of your primary guest. We think of these as design lenses -- ways of looking at your space through the eyes of the people you want to attract. These are the three most common guest profiles in vacation rentals.

### 1. The Couples Getaway

**The guest:** Couples seeking connection, relaxation, and escape from routine.

**Design priorities:**
- Luxurious master suite as the centerpiece (premium mattress, high-end bedding, mood lighting)
- Spa-quality bathroom details -- quality toiletries, plush towels, soft lighting
- Warm, moody color palette -- deep tones, rich textures, soft ambient lighting
- Intimate furniture arrangements -- seating for two, not six
- Minimal "family" cues (no bunk beds in hero photos, no plastic dinnerware)

**Revenue lever:** ADR premium. Couples-getaway guests tend to pay more per night and are less price-sensitive. They book based on how a space makes them feel.

**Design signal that separates the top tier:** A sense of curated intimacy. Think boutique hotel, not vacation house.

### 2. The Group Retreat

**The guest:** Friend groups, bachelor/bachelorette parties, reunion groups, adult families.

**Design priorities:**
- Large communal spaces that bring the group together (oversized sectionals, generous seating)
- Dining for full capacity -- this is non-negotiable
- Entertainment-forward furnishings (game tables, media room setup, ample outdoor seating)
- Multiple gathering zones so the group can split and recombine naturally
- Durable, high-quality furnishings that handle heavy use without showing wear

**Revenue lever:** Occupancy rate and group size. These properties book at higher total revenue because larger groups split the cost. The key is making every guest feel the space was designed for a group their size.

**Design signal that separates the top tier:** Flow. The best group retreat properties move people naturally between gathering spaces. Poor flow fragments the group and undermines the experience.

### 3. The Family Memory House

**The guest:** Multi-generational families, parents with kids, annual family trip groups.

**Design priorities:**
- Kid-friendly without being childish (durable materials, thoughtful furniture choices, playful design in kids' spaces)
- Bunk rooms or themed kids' rooms that children get excited about
- Functional kitchen and dining that handles real family meals at full capacity
- Storage and organization systems that keep chaos manageable
- Comfortable, forgiving materials throughout (performance fabrics, wipeable surfaces)

**Revenue lever:** Repeat bookings. Families are among the most loyal guest segments. When kids love a property, families come back year after year. Annual rebookings are one of the most valuable revenue streams in vacation rentals.

**Design signal that separates the top tier:** The kids' experience. A well-designed bunk room or play area doesn't just satisfy parents -- it creates the emotional hook that makes children ask to come back.

---

You do not need to choose just one lens. Many successful properties blend two (e.g., Family Memory House + Group Retreat). But you do need to be intentional. A property that tries to be everything to everyone ends up being nothing distinctive to anyone.

Your primary lens should inform every design decision: color palette, furniture selection, accessory priorities, photography angle, and listing copy. It is the strategic foundation that makes every other decision easier and more effective.

## The ROI Design Method

Understanding the Performance Stages and choosing your lens gives you the strategic foundation. But execution is where most investors stumble. Our approach comes down to three pillars, each one addressing a specific mistake we see repeatedly.

### Pillar 1: Strategic Budget

**The mistake:** Spending the wrong amount.

Most investors either underspend (trying to hit an arbitrary low number) or overspend (buying expensive pieces that don't move the needle on bookings). Both approaches produce poor returns.

**The method:** Your budget should be calibrated to your competitive set -- the properties you are actually competing against for bookings. It should account for ALL cost categories (furnishings, logistics, kitchen, installation, and design services), not just furniture. And it should be sized to position your property in the top tier of your market, not the middle.

### Pillar 2: Strategic Spending

**The mistake:** Spending on the wrong things.

Even with the right budget, many investors allocate it poorly. They splurge on a statement dining table but skip the curtains, rugs, and accessories that actually create the magazine effect in listing photos. They buy cheap mattresses (invisible in photos, devastating in reviews). They furnish for half capacity in a property that sleeps twelve.

**The method:** Invest where it impacts the 3 Performance Stages. Prioritize the items that stop the scroll (color, layering, styling), convert bookings (mattresses, full-capacity dining, complete kitchens), and create memorable experiences (thoughtful flow, quality finishes, cohesive theming). Optimize costs on items guests never notice or mention.

### Pillar 3: Strategic Placement

**The mistake:** Spending space currency the wrong way.

You can buy all the right items and still end up with a property that photographs poorly and feels awkward in person. How you arrange, style, and layer your space matters as much as what you put in it.

**The method:** Apply core design principles -- proportion, balance, layering, flow -- to create spaces that photograph beautifully and function intuitively for guests. This is the hardest pillar to execute without professional help, and it is often the difference between a property that looks "decorated" and one that looks "designed."

## Your Next Move

If you have read this far, you are already thinking about your property differently than most investors. You understand that design is not a line item to minimize -- it is a revenue lever. And you understand that the bar is only going up.

Here is what we recommend:

**1. Choose your primary lens.** Who is your ideal guest? What experience are they paying for? Let that answer guide every design decision.

**2. Audit your property against the 3 Performance Stages.** Where is it weakest -- stopping the scroll, converting bookings, or creating memorable experiences? That is where to focus first.

**3. Talk to our team.** We design spaces that outperform their comps -- that is the standard we hold ourselves to. We work with a limited number of investors in the St. George market and beyond. A conversation with us will give you clarity on what strategic design could do for your specific property -- no obligation, no pitch, just an honest assessment of where you stand and where the opportunity is.

**If that is what you are looking for, let's talk.**
