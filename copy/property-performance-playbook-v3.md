# The Property Performance Playbook

**How Top-Performing Vacation Rentals Are Designed — and Why Yours Should Be Too**

## The Uncomfortable Truth

The middle market for vacation rentals is getting squeezed.

Since 2020, active U.S. short-term rental listings have grown over 60%. That surge has slowed — but the inventory it created isn't going anywhere. Guests have more options than ever.

When supply outpaces demand, the properties that stand out take a disproportionate share of the bookings. The data bears this out: top-performing Airbnb hosts earn 29-64% more than average ones and fill roughly 20 more nights per year. One in four STR owners reported making no profit — or losing money — in 2024.

The properties in the middle — decent but unremarkable — are feeling it most. They're not bad enough to fail spectacularly. They're just not distinctive enough to stand out. In a market where guests scroll past dozens of listings in seconds, "good enough" is an expensive position to be in.

And the bar is going up. The AI boom is accelerating a K-shaped economy — the people who have money will have more of it, and their expectations will rise accordingly. The guests who can afford vacation rentals in the coming years will be wealthier, more discerning, and less willing to settle for mediocre spaces. At the same time, booking platforms are using AI-driven algorithms that track the entire guest journey and reward properties with strong quality signals. The pressure is coming from both directions.

**Interior design is not a line item on your budget. It is a revenue lever.** How you design your property determines whether it sits in the profitable top tier or gets squeezed in the middle.

This playbook will show you how.

## What's Actually at Stake

Before the how, the numbers.

Two investors buy comparable properties in St. George, Utah. Same neighborhood, same size, same purchase price. The only difference is how they approach interior design.

**Property A** has an overall design budget of **$50,000**. Functional but unremarkable — basic furniture, minimal accessories, no cohesive theme. It looks like a furnished house, not a destination.

- ~55% occupancy at $325/night
- ~$65,000/year gross revenue
- **-$11,500/year net cash flow**

Property A "saved" $40,000 on design. It loses money every month.

**Property B** invests **$90,000** in a strategically designed interior. The property photographs beautifully, converts browsers into bookers, and delivers experiences that generate five-star reviews and repeat bookings.

- ~70% occupancy at $375/night
- ~$96,000/year gross revenue
- **+$8,700/year net cash flow**

That's $20,200 more per year — on an extra $40,000 in design investment.

**Over five years:**

| | Property A | Property B |
|---|---|---|
| Design investment | $50,000 | $90,000 |
| Year 1 cash flow | -$11,500 | +$8,700 |
| 5-year cumulative | -$57,500 | +$43,500 |
| **Difference** | | **$101,000** |

A $101,000 swing. The $40,000 "savings" cost the investor six figures in lost cash flow.

So what actually separates these two properties? It's not just spending more. It's spending on the things that drive revenue.

## The 3 Performance Stages

Every design dollar should serve one of three jobs. They mirror the guest journey from first click to five-star review.

**Stage 1: Stop the Scroll**

Your listing photos are your storefront. Guests scroll through dozens of thumbnails before clicking on one. The properties that get clicks are the ones with visually distinctive, magazine-quality photos.

**What drives it:** Strategic color, cohesive styling, layered accessories, proper lighting, and a clear visual identity.

**The test:** Would someone pause mid-scroll and tap your listing? Or does it blend into the sea of gray-couch-white-wall interiors?

**Stage 2: Convert Browsers to Bookers**

Once a guest clicks, they're evaluating whether your property is worth the rate. Spaces that look intentional and well-appointed justify higher ADR. Spaces that look sparse or generic push guests to keep shopping.

**What drives it:** The layering — color, texture, art, theming, finishing details — along with the functional basics guests evaluate immediately: full-capacity dining, complete kitchen, quality mattresses and bedding.

**The test:** Does your listing justify a $50-75/night premium over comparable properties? Or are you competing on price?

**Stage 3: Create Memorable Experiences**

This is what happens after the guest arrives. Properties that deliver great in-person experiences generate five-star reviews, repeat bookings, and referrals. All of which compound over time.

**What drives it:** Thoughtful flow, real comfort, a sense of place that feels special rather than transactional.

**The test:** Do guests mention the property itself in their reviews? Or just the location?

## Who Are You Designing For?

The Performance Stages tell you what design should do. The next question is who it's for.

Not every guest wants the same thing. The most effective design starts with knowing your primary guest — what we think of as your design lens. Three profiles dominate vacation rentals.

**The Group Retreat**

**The guest:** Friend groups, bachelor/bachelorette parties, reunions, adult families.

**Design priorities:**
- Dining for full capacity — nothing signals "this place wasn't designed for us" faster than a six-person table in a property that sleeps twelve
- Oversized sectionals and generous seating
- Entertainment-forward furnishings (game tables, media setups, ample outdoor seating)
- Multiple gathering zones so the group can split and recombine naturally
- Durable, high-quality furnishings that handle heavy use without showing wear

**Revenue lever:** Occupancy and group size — larger groups split the cost, driving higher total revenue per booking. The key is making every guest feel the space was designed for a group their size.

**Design signal that separates the top tier:** Flow. The best group properties move people naturally between gathering spaces. Poor flow fragments the group and undermines the experience.

**The Family Memory House**

**The guest:** Multi-generational families, parents with kids, annual trip groups.

**Design priorities:**
- Kid-friendly without being childish — durable materials, thoughtful furniture choices, playful touches in kids' spaces
- Bunk rooms or themed kids' rooms that children get excited about
- A kitchen and dining setup that handles real meals at full capacity
- Storage and organization systems that keep chaos manageable
- Comfortable, forgiving materials throughout (performance fabrics, wipeable surfaces)

**Revenue lever:** Repeat bookings. Families are among the most loyal guest segments — when kids love a property, families come back year after year. Annual rebookings are one of the most valuable revenue streams in vacation rentals.

**Design signal that separates the top tier:** The kids' experience. A well-designed bunk room or play area doesn't just satisfy parents — it creates the emotional hook that makes children ask to come back.

**The Couples Getaway**

**The guest:** Couples paying for intimacy, not square footage.

**Design priorities:**
- Luxurious master suite as the centerpiece (premium mattress, high-end bedding, mood lighting)
- Spa-quality bathroom details — quality toiletries, plush towels, soft lighting
- Warm, moody color palette — deep tones, rich textures, soft ambient lighting
- Intimate furniture arrangements — seating for two, not six
- Minimal "family" cues (no bunk beds in hero photos, no plastic dinnerware)

**Revenue lever:** ADR premium. Couples tend to pay more per night and are less price-sensitive. They book based on how a space makes them feel.

**Design signal that separates the top tier:** A sense of curated intimacy — every detail feels intentional, not assembled.

You don't need to pick just one. Many successful properties blend two — Family + Group is a natural combination. But you do need to be intentional. A property designed for everyone is distinctive to no one.

## Spending Strategically

Knowing your guest and understanding the stages gives you the foundation. Execution is where most investors get it wrong. We see the same three mistakes.

**Mistake 1: Spending the wrong amount.** Most investors either underspend — trying to hit an arbitrary low number — or overspend on pieces that don't move the needle. Your budget should be calibrated to your competitive set, the properties you're actually up against for bookings. It should cover everything — furnishings, delivery, kitchen, installation, design services — not just furniture. And it should position you in the top tier of your market.

**Mistake 2: Spending on the wrong things.** Even with the right budget, many investors allocate it poorly. They put the whole budget into furniture and skip the curtains, rugs, and accessories that actually create the magazine effect in photos. They buy cheap mattresses — invisible in photos, devastating in reviews. The fix: invest where it impacts the Performance Stages. Prioritize what stops the scroll, converts bookings, and creates experiences.

**Mistake 3: Ignoring placement.** You can buy all the right items and still end up with a property that photographs poorly and feels awkward in person. How you arrange, style, and layer a space matters as much as what's in it. This is the hardest part to get right without professional help — and often the difference between a property that looks "decorated" and one that looks "designed."

## Your Next Move

If you've read this far, you're thinking about your property differently than most investors. The bar is going up. Here's what we recommend.

**1. Choose your lens.** Who is your ideal guest? What are they paying for? Let that guide every decision.

**2. Audit against the 3 stages.** Where is your property weakest — stopping the scroll, converting bookings, or creating experiences? Start there.

**3. Talk to us.** We design spaces that outperform their comps. We work with a limited number of investors in the St. George market and beyond, and a conversation will give you a clear picture of what strategic design could do for your property. No obligation, just an honest assessment.

**If that's what you're looking for, let's talk.**
